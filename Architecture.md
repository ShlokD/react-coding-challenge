### Architecture Design

Here the app is broken down into pages and the pages are broken down into subapps and components. 


This is done following the screaming architecture pattern where the folder names should be screaming the intent of the application.

Other principles followed are the SOLID principles and Composition.

The App uses TailwindCSS to introduce functional utility-css styles. The reason for functional CSS is that it helps keep the bundle size limited to the limit of CSS rules.
